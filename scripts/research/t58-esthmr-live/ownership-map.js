/* Who owns the Egyptian Exchange, as far as anybody has had to say — and what
 * moved in a given week.
 *
 * The picture is one board, not one board per period. Every company anybody
 * has filed a named stake in is drawn every time, at the stake that stands
 * now; choosing a week does not rebuild the market, it lights up the holdings
 * that changed in it. An earlier version of this screen accumulated filings
 * instead, so the first period showed a single company and read as a broken
 * map rather than a true one.
 *
 * Four honesty rules are in the drawing rather than written under it.
 *
 * The uncoloured part of a ring is NOT free float. It is ownership nobody has
 * had to disclose, which is most of every company on this exchange, and the
 * legend says so — calling it float would claim a fact about the register
 * that this project does not have.
 *
 * A stake is a percentage OF ONE COMPANY. Nothing here adds two of them
 * together: a holder who appears in three companies is drawn three times and
 * given no combined percentage, because 6% of one issuer and 2% of another do
 * not make 8% of anything.
 *
 * A standing stake is the closing figure of the last form filed on it, which
 * is a level the document prints. It is not a running total of movements, and
 * where the last form read it down to zero the holding is drawn as gone
 * rather than dropped — "sold out" and "never held" are different claims.
 *
 * And a company with no published market value keeps its ring at the floor
 * size with a dashed centre, rather than being guessed at or left out.
