Debt up by four fifths while profit crept 5% is the case to look at.',

      revOrientHigherMore:'Higher is simply more — more profit, or more earnings for each share. Above its sector means more than its peers, but the direction over time matters most: rising reads better than falling.',
      revOrientCash:'Higher is healthier. Above its sector means more of the reported profit actually arrived as cash than for its peers — money in the bank, not just profit on paper; below its sector means more of it is still on paper.',
      revOrientReturn:'Higher is the stronger side. Above its sector means the company turns each pound put into it into more profit than its peers do; below its sector is weaker. Steady-and-high reads better than high-but-jumpy.',
