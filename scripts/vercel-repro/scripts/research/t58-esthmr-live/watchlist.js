/* The reader's own list of companies.
 *
 * The same shape the app keeps (user_repository.dart): **a ticker and nothing
 * else**. It records that somebody wants to follow a company, not that they
 * own it — no share count, no cost basis, no risk tolerance. Anything more
 * would be a holding, and a holding is a fact about a person's money that this
 * publisher has no business storing.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY THAT CHANGED
 * It used to live only in this browser, namespaced to whoever was signed in.
 * That kept the site free of any per-reader record, and it also meant the list
 * died with the device: follow eleven companies on a laptop and a phone shows
 * none of them. Signed in, it is now kept against the account — the same email
 * the session already proves — so it follows the reader. Signed out there is
 * no account to keep it against, and the browser store is still the whole of
 * it.
 *
 * THE SERVER IS THE TRUTH WHEN THERE IS ONE
 * Local storage is a mirror, not a second opinion. Merging the two would make
 * removal impossible: unfollow a company on the laptop, and the phone — still
 * holding it locally — would push it back on its next visit, and it would
 * reappear on the laptop looking like a bug in the store rather than the merge.
 * The one exception is deliberate and happens once: whatever was followed
 * before signing in is adopted into the account, because losing it at the
 * moment of signing in is the one surprise a reader would blame on the
 * feature.
