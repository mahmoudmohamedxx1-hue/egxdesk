       them — dropping them would quietly shrink the market instead. The four
       bands sum to the coverage, which is the number printed beside the bar.

    /* §4: FIVE DESTINATIONS, AND EXPLORE'S ELEVEN IN THREE NAMED GROUPS.
       "Explore exposes 11 subsection choices before its search/filter/table
       experience. Feature names compete; users must choose an analysis
       technique before seeing an answer." Eleven equal buttons is not a menu,
       it is a quiz about this site's vocabulary — and the reader has to pass
       it before seeing a single figure.
       Nothing is removed and no route changes: every screen below is still one
       or two clicks from where it was, and `fragility` keeps its own URL. What
       changes is that the eleven arrive in three named groups, so a reader
       picks a KIND of question first. The groups are the review's own:
       Companies, Sectors, Maps & Research.

       Where each screen sits was settled by batching all nineteen through Jev
       against the five destinations. It agreed with the review outright on ten
       — home, market, company, investors, sectors, liquidity, fragility,
       research, tools, scenarios, all at 0.83 or better. It put `heat`,
       `ownership` and `calendar` elsewhere, but the review names those
       destinations in its own words, so the review wins where it speaks. It
       settled the two the review is silent on: `pairs` and `exchange`. */

  /** The market's own line, rebased to start where the company's line starts.

   * WHY REBASE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND AXIS
   * The question a reader actually has in front of a price chart is "is this
   * the company, or is it just the market?" — and it cannot be answered by a
   * price against an index, because 18.42 pounds and 55,498 points share no
   * scale. Two y-axes would be the usual answer and it is the wrong one: with
   * two axes the crossing point is chosen by whoever drew the chart, so the
   * same fortnight can be made to show the company ahead or behind.
   *
   * Rebasing removes that freedom. Both lines start at the same place — the
   * company's first close in the window — and every later index point is
   * moved by the same proportion the index moved. The gap between the lines
   * is then the only thing on the chart, and it means one thing: how far the
   * company has run ahead of, or behind, the market since that day.
   *
   * MATCHED BY DATE, NEVER BY POSITION
   * The two series are zipped on their dates, not their indexes. A company
   * that was suspended for three sessions has fewer points than the index
   * over the same fortnight, and lining the arrays up by position would slide
   * its whole line sideways against the market and draw a divergence that is
   * purely an off-by-three. Sessions the company did not trade are simply
   * absent from the ghost line.
